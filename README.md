# Resume
My resume and cv, written in LaTeX.
Uses the [moderncv](http://bit.ly/2vVHgd3) template,
and Python with [Jinja2](http://bit.ly/2vVWsGX) for templating.

## Building
Requires [GNU Make](http://bit.ly/2vCHSl4), poppler-utils,
ImageMagick, Python 2, and
[pdfLaTeX](http://bit.ly/2uHTJgH).

Run 
```
make
```
to make all the targets.

## Other resources
[This website](http://bit.ly/2w4evvf) can convert a pdf to word, in case a plaintext version is needed (running Pandoc produces an empty file).
